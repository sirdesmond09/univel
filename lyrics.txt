You have been
And You will be
You have seen
And You will see
You know when I rise and when I fall
When I come or go, You see it all
You hung the stars and You move the sea
And still You know me
You know me
You have been
And You will be
And You have seen
And You will see
You know when I rise and when I fall
When I come or go, You see it all
You hung the stars and You move the sea
And still You know me
You know me
And nothing is hidden from Your sight
Wherever I go, You find me
And You know every detail of my life
And You are God and You don't miss a thing
And nothing is hidden from Your sight
Wherever I go, You find me
And You know every detail of my life
'Cause You are God and You don't miss a thing
You know me
You know me
You know me
You memorize me
